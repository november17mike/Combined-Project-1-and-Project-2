## Combined-Project-1-and-Project-2
This is the combined repository for SQL Internship Projects: 
# Project 1- Online Retail Sales Analysis and Project 2- Inventory &amp; Warehouse Management

I have worked on **2 projects** in this *Internship duration at Elevate Labs as an SQL Intern*, namely: **Project1- Online Retail Sales Analysis** and **Project2- Inventory & Warehouse Management System**, both ***using Python as Frontend and MySQL as the backend Database***.

I chose to work on both the projects because the two have a specific link up, which i thought would add up to my knowledge and skills as i can merge both projects at a point of time where my 1st project would show and help an Enterprise to calculate and assess their monthly sales report through data analysis using Python as an interactive frontend and later the same Enterprise van use my 2nd Project as a means of their Stock and Warehouse management which will in case of a receding stock limit will send in alert report and in future also will add up to the management chain by suggesting a cross warehouse transfer to help mahage the resources.
